# Representation of Women in Film: Project Overview

> The [Bechdel test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bechdel_test), also known as the Bechdelâ€“Wallace test, is a measure of the representation of women in fiction. It asks whether a work features at least two women who talk to each other about something other than a man. The requirement that the two women must be named is sometimes added.

- Created a report that explores statistical models for predicting the bechdel test score of movies based on pre-production data
- Collected data from three separate data sources (bechdel test score, movie meta data, movie genre data) 
- Feature engineered predictor variables (female director, female writer, female ratio of crew, genre)
- Optimized regression and classification models (K-nearest-neighbors, stochastic gradient boosted, multinomial/logistic regression)
