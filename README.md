- Collected data from three separate data sources (bechdel test score, movie meta data, movie genre data) 
- Feature engineered predictor variables (female director, female writer, female ratio of crew, genre)
- Optimized regression and classification models (K-nearest-neighbors, stochastic gradient boosted, multinomial/logistic regression)
